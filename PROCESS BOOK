What I’ve worked on: Fetched one year of BTC/USDT daily OHLCV data from Binance using the ccxt library and loaded it into a pandas DataFrame.
What problems I encountered: Had to troubleshoot installation and version conflicts for ccxt; raw timestamps came back in milliseconds and needed conversion.
What I learned: How to configure and call ccxt’s fetch_ohlcv function; convert Unix-ms timestamps to pandas DateTime; forward-fill any missing trading days.

What I’ve worked on: Implemented two forecasting methods—Facebook Prophet and ARIMA(5,1,0) via statsmodels—and generated 30-day forecasts.
What problems I encountered: Prophet required renaming columns to “ds”/“y”; ARIMA order selection had convergence warnings until I chose (5,1,0).
What I learned: Prophet’s data schema and changepoint priors; reading ACF/PACF plots to justify ARIMA parameters.
Which resources did I use: Prophet official quick-start, statsmodels ARIMA tutorial, StackOverflow examples, ChatGPT advice.

What I’ve worked on: Added Holt–Winters exponential smoothing (additive trend & seasonality) and coded the Theta method for forecasting.
What problems I encountered: Determining the correct seasonal period parameter for ExponentialSmoothing; finding a reliable Theta implementation.
What I learned: How to call statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters.ExponentialSmoothing with seasonal_periods=365/12; the theory behind Theta’s two-line decomposition.

What I’ve worked on: Organized and merged each model’s 30-day forecast into a single DataFrame aligned by date.
What problems I encountered: Inconsistent index alignment and NaNs when concatenating different forecast series.
What I learned: How to use pandas.concat with axis=1 and DataFrame.reindex to align dates; fill gaps safely.

What I’ve worked on: Built a simple ensemble by averaging the four model forecasts and visualized actual vs. each model vs. ensemble with matplotlib.
What problems I encountered: Date formatting on the x-axis was cluttered; legend overlapped the plot.
What I learned: Use matplotlib.dates for cleaner tick formatting; place legends outside the plot area.

What I’ve worked on: Computed evaluation metrics for all forecasts and the naïve baseline.
What problems I encountered: Got mixed up on RMSE’s denominator; needed to sample errors at regular 4-day steps.
What I learned: Formulas for RMSE; how to slice a pandas Series by index positions for interval error reporting.
